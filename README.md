   git clone https://github.com/deydre/pagina-web-personal.git

2. Open the index.html file in your browser.


## 🌱 Challenges Faced
- I found some complexity in creating the hamburger menu in CSS with Flexbox, but it was simple to animate in JS.
- It was difficult to reorganize the project at the HTML and JS level when I moved the HTML files to the pages folder.
- Validating the form with JS has been complicated when it comes to storing the inputs, labels, and clearly understanding what each thing is.

## 🛠️ Future Improvements

- UX / Make the menu and footer less intrusive when scrolling.
- UX / Night Mode toggle for the entire website.
- Icons / Take them from Font Awesome (not imgs)
- Portfolio / Project filtering by tag.
